## Changes by OH2MP

On October 11th 2023 GeoGuessr changed some CSS names in their game and the extension stopped working. I can't live without it, so I had to fix it.

### Fixed issues and added features

  - Works with 2023 layout of GeoGuessr in Google Chrome and Firefox.
  - Works in quick play mode.
  - Works in Daily Challenge.
  - Works in country, US state and community streaks.
  - Shows times in streak summary page.
  - Starting a new game by clicking "Play Again" showed round times from the previous game.
  - Changed the layout so that in the classic mode the round times are under the map name etc. for to prevent overlap with the compass.
  - Removed color settings etc. because they were not compatible with the current layout at all.

### TODO

  - Remove a little outdated presonal times functionality? The code is still there but not used.
